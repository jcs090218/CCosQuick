# Welcome to the <span class="manual-name"></span> Scripting Reference!

This section of the documentation contains the details of the 
scripting API of the CCosQuick. To use this information, you 
should be familiar with Cocos Creator and the concept of 
the basic game engine architecture.

The scripting reference is organised according to the classes 
available to scripts which are described along with their methods, 
properties and any other information relevant to their use.
